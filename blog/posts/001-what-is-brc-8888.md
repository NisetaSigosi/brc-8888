*Source: generated with Flux — BRC-8888 quantum shield protecting Bitcoin*

Today marks the official public introduction of **BRC-8888**, the first Bitcoin-native protocol that brings true stateful, evolvable, and post-quantum-secure digital objects directly on top of Ordinals inscriptions — without sidechains, wrapped tokens, or consensus changes.

While BRC-20 and Runes gave Bitcoin fungible tokens and efficient UTXOs, they remain **static**. Once deployed, their rules are frozen forever.

BRC-8888 changes that.

### Core Innovation: The `evolve` Operation

BRC-8888 introduces a new inscription operations:
- `deploy` — create an object class (fungible, NFT, SFT, AI-aware, PQ identity, or generic)
- `mint` — issue units with phased pricing and per-wallet caps
- `transfer` — move units with lock checks
- **`evolve`** — commit a new Merkle root + Dilithium3 (NIST-approved post-quantum) signature

Every evolution is cryptographically verifiable and permanently stored on Bitcoin. This enables use cases impossible with any existing standard:
- Dynamic NFT traits that change based on time or external triggers  
- AI provenance chains (model_hash + signed training data)  
- Vesting schedules that unlock automatically  
- Quantum-resistant identities and credentials  
- On-chain game state progression  

All while remaining 100 % compatible with existing Ordinals indexers.

### UNQ — Quantum Edge (Genesis Object)

The first object deployed on BRC-8888 is **UNQ — Quantum Edge**:
- Ticker: UNQ  
- Supply: 21 000 000 (8 decimals)  
- Designed as the reference implementation and treasury-backed utility token for the protocol

UNQ demonstrates every feature of BRC-8888 in production: phased minting, treasury routing, founder vesting, and future AI trait unlocks, and post-quantum-signed evolutions.

### Technical Strengths Built for 2025–2030

- **Post-Quantum Security — Dilithium3 signatures (selected by NIST 2024) protect against harvest-now-decrypt-later attacks  
- Deterministic Indexing — no ambiguous rules; reference indexer written in pure Python (MIT)  
- Payload Efficiency — optional fields, dynamic address resolution from transaction outputs  
- Treasury Sustainability — mandatory 1 % on-chain fee funds ongoing development forever  
- Full Compatibility — works with UniSat, Xverse, OKX Wallet, Magic Eden, Gamma today  

### Why This Matters Now

With over 100 million inscriptions already on Bitcoin and quantum computers advancing faster than expected, the need for **upgradeable, quantum-resistant assets** has never been clearer.

BRC-8888 is the first protocol built from day one to survive that future.
